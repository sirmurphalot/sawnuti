Description: The SAWNUTI algorithm performs sequence comparison for finite sequences of discrete events with non-uniform time intervals. Further description of the algorithm can be found in the paper: A. Murph, A. Flynt, B. R. King (2021). Comparing finite sequences of discrete events with non-uniform time intervals, Sequential Analysis, 40(3), 291-313. <doi:10.1080/07474946.2021.1940491>.
